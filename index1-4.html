    Hi, my name is Hsiang Ting Wang. I am learning about web development. I started exploring this field during the pandemic and found it fascinating. This field is constantly envolving, and I enjoy learning new things. After some self-study, I decided to pursue certificates, so I am currently taking courses. I am working to balance my life between taking care of my family and striving towards to my goals.
